Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning  
3. Reinforcement Learning

Applications include recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.
