Vector Databases and Embeddings

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. These databases have become increasingly important with the rise of machine learning and AI applications that rely on vector representations of data.

Key Features:
- High-dimensional vector storage
- Similarity search capabilities
- Scalable indexing methods
- Real-time query performance

Popular vector databases include:
- Qdrant
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Chroma
- Milvus

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data that capture semantic meaning. They are commonly used in:
- Recommendation systems
- Search engines
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
